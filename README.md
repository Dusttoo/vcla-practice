{
    id: 9, // Use next available ID
    topic: "comma-usage", // Topic category
    difficulty: "medium", // easy, medium, hard, expert
    type: "multiple-choice",
    question: "Your question text here?",
    choices: [
        "Choice A text",
        "Choice B text", 
        "Choice C text",
        "Choice D text"
    ],
    correct: 1, // Index of correct answer (0-based)
    explanation: {
        title: "Explanation Title",
        steps: [
            {
                number: 1,
                title: "Step title",
                content: "Step explanation",
                type: "thinking" // thinking, correct, mistake, tip
            }
            // Add more steps as needed
        ]
    }
}
```

### Method 2: Using the Helper Function

Use the `addNewQuestion()` function provided in `questions.js`:

```javascript
addNewQuestion({
    topic: "parallel-structure",
    difficulty: "hard",
    type: "multiple-choice",
    question: "Which sentence demonstrates proper parallel structure?",
    choices: [
        "She likes swimming, running, and to bike.",
        "She likes swimming, running, and biking.",
        "She likes to swim, running, and biking.",
        "She likes swim, run, and bike."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: {
        title: "Parallel Structure Rules",
        steps: [
            {
                number: 1,
                title: "Identify the series",
                content: "Look for items in a list that should follow the same pattern",
                type: "thinking"
            },
            {
                number: 2,
                title: "Check consistency",
                content: "All items should use the same grammatical form (gerunds: -ing)",
                type: "correct"
            }
